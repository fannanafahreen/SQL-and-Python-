This project demonstrates a collection of SQL queries intended to examine an e-commerce dataset and extract insightful information. Important analytics include figuring out the percentage of installment-based purchases, calculating total sales per product category, counting orders placed in a specific year, and identifying unique client cities. Furthermore, intermediate queries go deeper into trends. For example, they examine the relationship between product price and frequency of purchases, calculate revenue contributions by product category, evaluate the average number of products per order by city, and analyze monthly order patterns for a specific year. These queries demonstrate how SQL may be used practically for data-driven decision-making.
